In an ecosystem there is a balance between prey, and predators. Effect in any of the species may result in a negative effect to that ecosystem. These effects may arise due to various natural causes such as disaster or forest fires. The idea was to take a note of a ecosystem and keep studying its species details. And give an alert in the case a particular species becomes too low in count and also tell which species it is affecting.
