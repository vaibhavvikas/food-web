# Food Web

In an ecosystem there is a balance between prey, and predators. Effect in any of the species may result in a negative effect to that ecosystem. These effects may arise due to various natural causes such as disaster or forest fires. The idea was to take a note of a ecosystem and keep studying its species details. And give an alert in the case a particular species becomes too low in count and also tell which species it is affecting.

> Im currently working on a better visualization using d3.js and Angular alongwith the backend via Python Flask. It is inside Visualization Folder

## Note: ##

This is still in progress application. Rather then a Tkinter UI, I tried to make an angular application so it connects to python flask app to get the data from the json and we can see the network graph in an UI with Angular

``` I will work on the project in the future when I will get time. ```

Screenshot of the graph. Made using **d3.js**
