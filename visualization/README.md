## Note: ##

This is still in progress application. Tather then a Tkinter UI, I tried to make an angular application so it connects to python flask app to get the data from the json and we can see the network graph in an UI with Angular

``` I will work on the project in the future when I will get time. ```

Screenshot of the graph. Made using **d3.js**
